# TheFunctionofFashion
Phase 1 Project for Andres Gordillo and Tarique Smith 

The project consists of building a digital storefront where a user can choose articles of clothing. They will be able to filter by types of clothing, and will be given a total upon expressing their intention to buy. 

We will also try and include the ability to add comments/reviews for the clothing, so that others may read buyers' opinions.
